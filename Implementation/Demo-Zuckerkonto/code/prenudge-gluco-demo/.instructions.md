Pattern-based file instructions for dynamic application

- Apply to: routes/*.js, service/*.js, middleware/*.js, bin/*, views/*, public/javascripts/*
- Purpose: prefer explicit error returns, async/await, consistent logging (use `debug` and `morgan`).
- For route handlers: validate inputs, return proper HTTP status codes, avoid blocking I/O on request path.
- For DB services: use the `lowdb` adapter patterns already in `service/db.js`.
